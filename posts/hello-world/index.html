        <h1><a href="http://blog.abualsamid.com/posts/hello-world/">To Node or to Go</a></h1>

        <div class="post">
            <p>The recent news of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/12/io-js/">trouble in node</a> land is unsettling. Nodejs is am amazing technology with a big following. Companies such as Linked-In bought into it from the early beginning. Microsoft is making it a first class citizen in the Visual Studio eco system. AWS just launched a new <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">service</a> based on node, and has a great sdk for it. <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> has embraced it from the get go and is now the corporate sponsor.  This is just a small set of nodejs related projects and companies, the list is huge.</p>

<p>We use nodejs for our home grown development tracking and management system and we are currently in the process of building out micro services to support our ever growing <a href="http://www.estratex.com/">SaaS offering</a>. Up till now the plan was to build out those micro services in nodejs. Now, being micro services, they do not really need to be all written in a single language. Especially those days with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> taking over the world, it is very easy to develop different services in different technologies.</p>

<p>None the less, we would like to know that we have a goto option for a micro service build out, that we made a strategic decision to commit to a direction. Up till few days ago, that direction was Nodejs.</p>

<p>We have not changed our minds yet, Nodejs is not going away, and it still supported by a strong backer and if good things happen the rift will be healed and the community will come back together and keep pushing it forward.</p>

<p>However, we are now considering other options. One of the things that we have considered seriously is Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>. It is a beautiful language, statically linked, so it is perfect for Docker deployment. It is supported by Google and has a ton of packages. What it does not have, yet, is an official AWS SDK from Amazon. That&rsquo;s really the main reason that tilted the scale in favor of nodejs, up till now.</p>

<p>Now, it is decision time, to Node || to Go</p>
